# Svelte Todo 📝
```bash
https://svelte-todo-12c71.web.app
```

## About 🧐
While leaning about Svelte I decided to build this Todo App. Where user can securly login via google authentication and specify categories based on their requirements and add tasks to complete at a time. When user decides to come back to site they can found their tasks.

### learning 📋
During building Svelte-Todo I get to learn about these things:

- How to use Svelete runes
- How page.svelte and layout.svelte file behave and work
- How to pass props(with runes) to child component and vice-versa
- How Stores are created and used in other places
- Basic routing
- Firebase Authentication
- Deploy and Hosting with Firebase
- Integrate Google Analytics

### Limitation and Future scope ⏳
Soul purpose of this web-app is to playaround with Svelte along with Firebase to handle data, and deployment. 
Modern Todo Apps have far more features available than this one and due to time limitations and purpose of building, I implemented only 1-2 features.
