# Svelte Todo 📝
```bash
https://svelte-todo-12c71.web.app
```

## About 🧐
While learning about Svelte, I decided to build this Todo App. Users can securely log in via Google authentication, create custom categories based on their needs, and add tasks to complete at their convenience. When users return to the site, they can find their tasks waiting for them.

### What I Learned 📋
While building Svelte-Todo, I gained experience with the following:

- How to use Svelete runes
- How `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte` files behave and work
- How to pass props(with runes) to child component and vice versa
- How Stores are created and used across app
- Basic routing in Svelte
- Firebase Authentication
- Deploy and Hosting with Firebase
- Integrating Google Analytics

### Limitation and Future Scope ⏳
The sole purpose of this web app was to experiment with Svelte for learning and Firebase for data management and deployment. Modern Todo apps offer far more features than this one, but due to time constraints and the project’s purpose, I focused on implementing just a few key features.
